# agent-based-modeling

Welcome! This repository was created for the ST 313 Ethics for Data Science Final Project at London School of Economics. The goal of our project was to explore the discrimination in algorithmic decision making using agent-based models.

- The repository contains agent-based modeling code using the mesa library. 
Source: https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/intro_tutorial.html#introductory-tutorial
- Models we used in producing the final results can be found in the folder "Models".
- Results are presented as graphs for the two cases we explored: Discrimination and Discrimination with Policy Intervention.
